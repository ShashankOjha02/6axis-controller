# Intro
The Queen’s Space Engineering Team (QSET) had been looking to develop a new one-handed control system for its Mars rover’s robotic arm, in order to address key observations faced during past University Rover Challenge (URC) competitions. The previous controller required two hands to operate, forcing the rover driver to alternate between arm and chassis control. This not only made operation more difficult during high-pressure tasks but also increased the chance of error during the communication between different operators.
Our team followed a structured design approach based on stakeholder needs, human-device interface theory, and iterative engineering practices. Beginning with a clear project definition, we engaged in information gathering, including routine stakeholder meetings to make sure the expectations were aligned at every stage. Eventually assembling a QFD quality house that would serve as a benchmark throughout the process. 
The new design focuses on usability and learnability, while ensuring performance. The controller features a delta-robot-inspired mechanism for intuitive translational movement and rotational joints for precise orientation control. Arduino-based firmware processes six potentiometer inputs to produce accurate six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) signals. Sustainability and accessibility were also key considerations, with recyclable PETG filament used for 3D-printed components and design features to support users with varying physical abilities. To ensure alignment with engineering ethics and integrity, the development process integrated ethical, societal, and environmental considerations, while adhering to regulatory constraints set by the URC. Good project management and a comprehensive budgeting plan enabled efficient material sourcing, build scheduling, and cost tracking, keeping the project on time and within the budget. Throughout, we employed CAD modeling, ergonomic simulation, and control system prototyping to refine both function and form.
Testing and validation were central to our process. Testing showed that most performance metrics were within or close to target values. We designed a robust testing suite to assess actuation distance, force, and responsiveness across all control axes. Quantitative usability and learnability metrics confirmed improved performance relative to the legacy controller. While initial trials showed that the new system requires a longer familiarization period, its intuitive layout is expected to outperform the previous setup in real-world conditions. 
Ultimately, the controller was slightly heavier and larger than the initial goals but still met the constraints set by the client. The actuation force was somewhat higher than expected, especially in the vertical Z axis, but did not hinder user performance. A key challenge was the disruption force: the controller would occasionally slide during use. This is being addressed by adding rubber feet to improve stability.
Although the learning curve for the new controller was steeper than anticipated during testing, this result does not fully reflect real-world use. Compared to the old system, the new, more accessible and efficient controller has strong potential to reduce training time and improve operator confidence, especially once adapted into the robot arm. This the new design offers a promising path forward and better prepares the team for future URC editions.
